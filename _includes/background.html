      I’m a Computer Science student at the 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/index.html" target="_blank">University of Alberta</a> 
      with a passion for building high-quality software across data, web, and game development. 
      I’ve worked as a Data Analyst Intern at Chase IT Consulting, where I built Power BI dashboards, 
      automated validation pipelines, and supported large-scale data and ETL workflows. 
      I’ve also contributed to full-stack projects and helped build end-to-end web experiences, 
      including launching <i>Forteguard.ca</i> and maintaining multiple WordPress sites.

      Beyond analytics, I enjoy engineering interactive and scalable software. I’ve built a complete 
      2D platformer in Unreal Engine 5, developed a distributed real-time collaboration app using Python, 
      Flask, and WebSockets, and actively contribute to the UofA Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project by 
      improving ROS2 modules, documentation, and developer tools.

      Across all my work, I focus on creating systems that feel smooth, intuitive, and performant — whether 
      it’s a clean dashboard, a responsive web app, or a fast gameplay mechanic. My goal is always the same: 
      build reliable, well-designed software that feels great to use.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably at the gym, cooking, spending time with my friends and family, 
      or enjoying a good book.
