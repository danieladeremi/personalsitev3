      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and user requirements, combining my technical knowledge 
      with my soft skills to create a basis for building a successful product. 
      My goal is to design and deliver applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood 
      while providing a strong base for further development of product features and engaging user experiences.

      I conceive of the professional as a whole, thus I am striving to improve in multiple and diverse aspects. 
      Philosophy, minimalism, and stoicism are subjects that interest me in my personal time, alongside various other hobbies such as music, literature, riding and restoring classic cycles etc.
      I'm excited to talk about these — feel free to ask!
